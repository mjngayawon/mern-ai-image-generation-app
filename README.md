# 📹 AI Image Generator App

This project is built using the powerful **MERN stack**, which includes **MongoDB**, **Express.js**, **React.js**, and **Node.js**, providing a robust foundation for full-stack web development. For styling, it leverages **Tailwind CSS**, one of the most popular and efficient utility-first CSS frameworks available today. The app uses **Puter.js** to handle dynamic image generation, making it easy to create custom visuals on the fly. Generated images are stored and managed through **Cloudinary**, a cloud-based media storage service that ensures fast and reliable delivery.
